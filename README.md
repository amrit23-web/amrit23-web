  ## Hi there! 👋 I'm Amritanshu Sharma.<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iampavangandhi/iampavangandhi/master/gifs/Hi.gif" width="30px">
  <img width="55%" align="right" alt="Github" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48678280/88862734-4903af80-d201-11ea-968b-9c939d88a37c.gif" />
  
  As a highly motivated and results-oriented professional, I am passionate about leveraging my skills in data science to
  help businesses achieve their objectives. Currently pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science Engineering with a focus on
  data science, I am constantly seeking out new ways to learn and grow in this dynamic field.
  
  I thrive in fast-paced environments where I can apply my abilities to achieve meaningful results. Whether it's through
  developing cutting-edge algorithms or analyzing complex datasets, I am committed to delivering innovative solutions
  that drive success.
  
  
  
  
  - 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and NLP.

  <!-- ## About Me 
  
  I enjoy discovering new ideas and learning new things. Maybe I don't have the answer to every difficulty. But I know
  how to solve the problem.
  
  My primary programming languages are Python and C++. Python and Data Structures and Algorithms are my strongest areas.
  Aside from these, I am familiar with Web Development, Computer Networking, Operating Systems, and databases (MongoDB).
